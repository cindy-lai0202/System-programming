HW2 is from the exercise 13-5

The command tail [ â€“n num ] file prints the last num lines (ten by default) of the
named file. Implement this command using I/O system calls (lseek(), read(), write(),
and so on). Keep in mind the buffering issues described in this chapter, in order to
make the implementation efficient.

$ ./HW2.out -n num filename
